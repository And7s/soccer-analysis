# Football data analysis

This is a projct to read and analyse position data of the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL). The program repads and analysies those data based on multiple metrics and displays meaningful cahrts in an interactive way.

In order to track the running performance of football players during official Bundesliga matches, the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) has deployed a video based tracking system. This tracking system collects location and speed of every individual player with a frequency of 25 hertz. An analysis of this data allows clubs, trainers, and scientists to conclude about accomplished performance of players and their team. To make use of this data it has to be analyzed and visualized. This requires the transformation into a diagnostic relevant Data metrics.

The purpose of this interdisciplinary project(IDP) is to provide a basis of scientific research on a collection of relevant metrics based on given data sets. In especial we want to put exhaustion in correlation with speed, acceleration and additional parameters. The goal is to implement a data analysis tool with an easy to use interface, uses the provided DFL data sets and generate visualizations that also can be export the results in a reusable data format for further processing.

This project has been written by Andreas Schmelz i collaboration with the sportinformatics faculty of TUM.

I did write a documentation with background regarding the origin of the data, its interpretation how the program works and which data it creates.

## key features
  - Read the provided position data sets
  - Set this data in relation to associated data files match-information and event-data
  - Analyze the data according to relevant defined metrics and formulas
  - These Formulas should have partially adjustable parameters
  - The tool should immediately present results
  - It should be possible to export the results for post processing and statistically analysis in external tools
  - This analysis should be applicable to many (100+) files in one export-run
